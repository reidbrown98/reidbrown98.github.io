  First description 
  <br>I am a recent graduate of UNC-Chapel Hill with a B.S. in Environmental Science as well as a minor in Statistics and Analytics. I created this portfolio to highlight my technical skills I have developed in some of my classes. I am looking for work as an entry level data analyst where I could continue to grow this skill set.<br>
